            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                I am a 22-year-old programmer with a passion for crafting elegant and efficient code. My journey in
                programming began in October 2021, when I started studying through online courses. I completed these
                courses in January 2023 and began working professionally in November 2023, where I am currently
                employed.

                While the TALL stack is where I shine, my primary programming language is <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I
                enjoy leveraging its versatility to create seamless user experiences and powerful web applications.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">My Journey</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Though my formal study of programming has been relatively brief, I have a relentless drive to improve
                and excel in my craft. Every project I undertake is an opportunity to learn something new and refine my
                skills. This ambition fuels my growth as a developer and ensures that I am always up-to-date with the
                latest trends and technologies in the industry.
            </p>
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8">Beyond Code</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Outside of programming, I am a curious and motivated individual. I believe in continuous improvement,
                not just in coding, but in all aspects of life. This mindset helps me tackle challenges head-on and
                persist through difficulties, always striving to be better than I was yesterday.
